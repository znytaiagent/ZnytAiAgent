export const REGISTER_BASENAME_PROMPT = `
This tool will register a Basename for the agent. The agent should have a wallet associated to register a Basename.
When your network ID is 'base-mainnet' (also sometimes known simply as 'base'), the name must end with .base.eth, and when your network ID is 'base-sepolia', it must ends with .basetest.eth.
Do not suggest any alternatives and never try to register a Basename with another postfix. The prefix of the name must be unique so if the registration of the
Basename fails, you should prompt to try again with a more unique name.
