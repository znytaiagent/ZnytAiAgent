export const TRADE_PROMPT = `This tool will trade a specified amount of a 'from asset' to a 'to asset' for the wallet.

It takes the following inputs:
- The amount of the 'from asset' to trade
- The from asset ID to trade 
- The asset ID to receive from the trade

Important notes:
- Trades are only supported on mainnet networks (ie, 'base-mainnet', 'base', 'ethereum-mainnet', 'ethereum', etc.)
- Never allow trades on any non-mainnet network (ie, 'base-sepolia', 'ethereum-sepolia', etc.)
- When selling a native asset (e.g. 'eth' on base-mainnet), ensure there is sufficient balance to pay for the trade AND the gas cost of this trade`;
